## College Lab Projects

Here are some of my college lab projects that showcase my skills in OOP using Java:

 - **[Matrix Operations: ](https://github.com/your-username/matrix-operations)**  
  A Program that performs basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, demonstrating the use of multi-dimensional arrays.

- **[Sum of Numbers: ](https://github.com/richujoseph/Object-oriented-programming-using-Java/blob/main/sum.java)**
  A program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and calculates their sum.

- **[String Palindrome Checker: ](https://github.com/richujoseph/Object-oriented-programming-using-Java/blob/main/pal.java)** 
  A program that checks if a given string is a palindrome, demonstrating string manipulation and control structures.
  
- **[Frequency Counter: ](https://github.com/richujoseph/Object-oriented-programming-using-Java/blob/main/fre.java)**  
  A program that counts the frequency of each character in a string, showcasing the use of data structures and.and algorithms.

-  **[Hello Program: ](https://github.com/richujoseph/Object-oriented-programming-using-Java/blob/main/hello.java)**
A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
  
- **[Abstract Class Example: ](https://github.com/your-username/abstract-class-example)**  
  A demonstration of abstract classes and methods in Java, illustrating the concept of abstraction in OOPS.

- **[Polymorphism Demonstration: ](https://github.com/your-username/polymorphism-demo)**  
  A project that showcases method overloading and overriding, highlighting the polymorphic behavior of Java.

- **[Try and Catch Example: ](https://github.com/your-username/try-catch-example)**  
  A simple program that demonstrates exception handling using try-catch blocks to manage runtime errors.

- **[Inheritance Example: ](https://github.com/your-username/inheritance-example)**  
  A project that illustrates the concept of inheritance in Java, showing how subclasses can inherit properties and methods from parent classes.
